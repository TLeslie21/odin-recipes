    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>An awesome and easy way to make pulled chicken. It makes a great sandwich, 
        taco, potato topper, or anything else you can think of!
    </p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>cooking spray</li>
        <li>3 cups canned tomato sauce</li>
        <li>1 1/2 cups ketchup</li>
        <li>1 (4 pound) whole chicken</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Spray a large slow cooker with cooking spray. Add tomato sauce 
            and ketchup; stir until well combined.</li>
        <li>Clean the chicken and tie the legs. Add to the slow cooker
            and turn several times to coat in the sauce</li>
        <li>Cover and cook on Low for 5 to 7 hours or on High for 3 to 4 hours.
            An instant-read thermometer inserted into the thickest part of the thigh, 
            near the bone, should read 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Remove chicken from the pot. Shred meat into a bowl and remove/discard all bones.
            Put chicken back into the slow cooker and stir to combine with the sauce.</li>
    </ol>
